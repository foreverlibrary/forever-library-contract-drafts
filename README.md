# forever-library-contract-drafts

(this was our original repository for early drafts of the Forever Library smart contract)

Forever Library is a shared public good for all artists to mint and preserve their music onchain.

It is simply meant to be an open ERC-721 NFT minting contract, which anyone can utilize regardless of liveness of a particular front end.

The primary tenets of this contract include:
Non-Upgradeable - it is meant to serve as steady and long-term bedrock for minting front-ends, marketplaces, and indexers to utilize and build upon.
Publicly mintable - all can utilize this contract openly.
Immutable metadata - tokens are meant to be a permanent statement. Future edits should be done with newly minted tokens, burning previous immutable tokens.
Optimzed for provenance - helping artists establish a future proof onchain provenance trail is a key goal of Forever Library.

This contract features an external rendering toggle as well, which can be utilized for minting code-based work.

All feedback and suggestions are welcome and encouraged!
